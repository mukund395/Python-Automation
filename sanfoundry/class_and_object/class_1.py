# class foo:
#     def __init__(self,x):
#         self.x = x
#     def __lt__(self, other):
#         print("this function is called")
#         return self.x + other.x
#     def __gt__(self, other):
#         print("this function gt is called")

# print(a>b)
# print(a<b)

# when we compare a<b the lt method will be initilised
# Your understanding is partially correct. The __lt__ method is specifically used when you
# use the less-than operator (<) to compare two objects. If you use any other
# comparison operator, such as greater-than (>), equal-to (==), etc., without having the corresponding special methods
# (__gt__, __eq__, etc.) defined in your class, Python won't raise an error, but the default behavior might not be what you expect.


# class MyClass:
#     def __init__(self, value):
#         self.value = value
#
#     def __lt__(self, other):
#         print("__lt__ method is called")
#         return self.value < other.value
#
# # Example usage:
# obj1 = MyClass(5)
# obj2 = MyClass(10)
#
# # Using the less-than operator calls __lt__
# result_lt = obj1 < obj2
# print(result_lt)  # Output: __lt__ method is called, True
#
# # Using the greater-than operator does not call __lt__
# result_gt = obj1 > obj2
# print(result_gt)  # Output: False (default behavior, no error)
#
# # Using the equal-to operator does not call __lt__
# result_eq = obj1 == obj2
# print(result_eq)  # Output: False (default behavior, no error)
